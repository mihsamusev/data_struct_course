This is my self study project where i pursue the following goals
* Learn popular data structurs and their implementations from this YouTube lecture https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSGKlAvoiM&list=WL&index=61&t=0s
* Implement the data structures from scratch in C++
* Perform Google unit testing on the data structures
* Provide cmake files to compile the data structures into a static library
* Keep a well organized github repository inspired by (https://github.com/kigster/cmake-project-template)

Building the static library with cmake
mkdir build
cd mkdir
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
cmake --build .
